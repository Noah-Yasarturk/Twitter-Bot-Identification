# US_Elections_4_Twits
Implementing basic Twitter scraping techniques, I hope to be able to predict the outcome of U.S. elections. This was initiated in 2016 but continued in 2018.


I am currently (Fall 2018) renewing this project in much greater depth. This time, i hope to predict the outcomes of the House races for the U.S. 2018 midterms. My hope is to be able to mine Twitter for a week, separate suspected bot accounts from the rest, score the Tweets based upon a variety of factors, and generate a graphic depicting red and blue states as per my prediction. I'll attempt to separate the predicted map with and without the suspected bots so as to understand the potential impact of the bots. I am conducting this project under the mentorship of Dr. Wu and Richard Marquet.
